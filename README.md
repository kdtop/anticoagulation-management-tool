# Anticoagulation management tool

This is a modification of the AMT Anticoagulation management tool
released by the VA.

This version represents a major rewrite.  I estimate that 80% of the code
was rewritten.  Some features have been added, other features have been
pulled out.

The purpose of this application is for use in my private medical office.
I am releasing the code in case others are interested. I will attempt
to keep this repository up to date as future modifications are made.
